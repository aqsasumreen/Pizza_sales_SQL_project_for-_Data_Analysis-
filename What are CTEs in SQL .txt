----------- What are CTEs in SQL? ------------------

CTE (Common Table Expression) is a temporary result set in SQL that you can reference within a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.
It improves readability and organization of complex queries.
#### CTE ek temporary table hoti hai jo WITH clause ke through banai jati hai ,,,  
### yeh table sirf ussi query ke dauran  rehti hai jahan use define kiya gaya ho.

-> Synatax

WITH cte_name AS (
    -- Your SQL query
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
)
-- Use the CTE like a table
SELECT *
FROM cte_name;

âœ… How CTEs Work:
The WITH clause defines a temporary result set (the CTE).
This CTE can then be referenced just like a table in the main query that follows.
It only exists during the execution of that single query.

| Use Case                       | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Readability**                | Breaks down complex queries into logical blocks.                            |
| **Reusability**                | You can refer to the same logic multiple times in one query.                |
| **Recursive Queries**          | Can perform recursive operations like hierarchical data (e.g., org charts). |
| **Avoid Subquery Duplication** | Instead of writing the same subquery multiple times, use a CTE once.        |

-> Example:

WITH SalesCTE AS (
  SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT *
FROM SalesCTE
WHERE total_sales > 1000;


-> Example

WITH top_customers AS (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total_spent
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT * FROM top_customers WHERE total_spent > 5000;
